GrammarSlammer! The app!


Description:
All too often, the masses on Facebook butcher the English language with terrible grammar. For those Facebook users who, like me, cringe upon seeing some incoherent version of English, this app provides a solution. The app scans your facebook homepage and transforms those grammatic tragedies into good ol' fashioned English.


Some specifics:

			1) This app will only transform one's own homepage and only when activated.

			2) One can target specific repeated offenders with this app and leave the rest of your homepage alone.

			3) When using the app, one can elect to send a friendly (okay... maybe slightly pretentious) facebook message which will alert the user of his/her grammatic shortcomings and notify him that he is currently in your Grammar Slammer.

			4) The app will recognize and permit some slang. The app user can set preferences on which slang items are allowed.

			5) One can also elect for the app to scan his or her own status updates before they are published (A great option for the grammatically-challenged). This will be a pumped up version of spell-check, basically. 

			6) Another feature of GrammarSlammer 

Some possible difficulties:

			1) Because of the lax grammatic nature of Facebook, some status updates may prove too challenging to even begin to understand and correct. A possible solution to this could be a simple warning message such as, "(Your name here), you are about to read something that will make you dumber if not properly prepared. Take precaution."

			2) An app user could become a complete tool and drive all of his/her friends away with the incessant emails about minor grammatic mistakes. The solution here may be that a Facebook user must reach a certain level of grammatic error before the option to send a message occurs. For example, the Facebook user may have to reach Grammatic Murderer status, or the like.

			3) The app will undoubtedly misunderstand slang and translate it into the wrong word, completely changing the meaning of a person's status. A possible solution is to have a 'hide/show' option on each status update currently affected by the app. This will allow the app user to easily see the original content.


An example of what we are fighting over here a GrammarSlammer:

			 A common grammatic crime is using ridiculously long run-on sentences that are comprised of mainly nonsense. For example, "i wuz gunna go to the mall today but than i saw my friend callie and she was acting crazy and i thot that gurl is crazy so then i went with her to get some expresso and i hate expresso lol haha :) :) "


 So fight the good fight, and put those grammar criminals in the GrammarSlammer!
